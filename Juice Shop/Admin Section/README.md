Finding the Admin Section was a bit more difficult than the Score Board. After
searching around the HTML for "admin", or similar terms, I found nothing.

I tried a few obvious URLs like `/#/admin`, `/#/admin-section`, etc. and still
no luck.

I decided to try poking around in the JS code, which looks like it has a lot of
goodies. Searching for "admin" in this file turned up some much more
interesting results. It eventually led me to the `/#/administration` URL, and
viola!
